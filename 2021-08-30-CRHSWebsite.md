A Cinco Ranch High School website was long overdue, and finally, like the strong independent women in STEM that I was, I decided to make one for my school. The first thing that I did was go on my favorite website to learn new things, Udemy. I followed a course on how to create a website using PHP. I ran into many bugs along the way, including almost accidentally deleting the whole project. I think my favorite part about this project was helping the Cinco Ranch High School Orchestra establish a public platform where the directors could put all files and trip notifications in one central place. I think that it is much more convenient than having the information on multiple different platforms. I think my orchestra directors were pretty happy with it, and I'm thankful for the chance to make this lasting impression on the high school orchestra before I leave for college. WEE!
