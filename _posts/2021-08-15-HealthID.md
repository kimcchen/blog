HealthID was an app that my fellow IDEA teammates and I made at the HackTheNortheast hackathon.
This was the first hackathon I had participated in a long time, and I was very lucky to
have such patient and supportive teammates who helped teach me how to utilize Flutter to create the app's UI.
The basic premise of the app was to make it easier for people to track their health
over time by compiling all of the data they inputted into one simple QR code. To my surprise,
this app won the "Best UI/UX" division. We each got a polaroid camera, which I have to admit
was pretty cool. But most importantly, this hackathon showed me how much fun computer science
was, and encouraged me to participate in more hackathons and learn more Flutter on my own. <br>
